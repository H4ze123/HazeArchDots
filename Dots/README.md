### 🌟 INSTALLATION:

> Should work on pretty much any arch based system (minimal, or not). If theres an issue installing, please submit a bug report! 

```
bash <(curl -s https://gdrc.me/dots.sh)
```

> If the above command doesnt work, you are likely using a non-standard shell (like fish). Try running this command instead (assumes bash is installed, install `bash` with pacman otherwise).

```
bash -c "$(curl -s https://gdrc.me/dots.sh)"
```

  <summary>🤔 Dont like curl bash?</summary>

  <p></p>

  Thats fair, heres a more rigid method. 
  
  Ensure dependencies & update
  ```
  sudo pacman -Syu
  sudo pacman -S --needed git base-devel
  ```
  Begin Installation
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/GeodeArc/GeoDots/ $HOME/GeoDots
  cd $HOME/GeoDots/
  ./install.sh
  ```

  > Feel free to inspect install.sh, and any other scripts inside of /Installation/.

  - Clone the repo. I hope you know how to do this already.
  - Head over the the gh-pages branch, and install the dependencies in the text files labeled 'pkg'. Not everything is 'technically' required.
  - Go to each config folder in /.config/, and if required, move a config (e.g modern+light) to the root of that folder.
  - Copy folders from /.config/ to your .config folder
  - Copy the /Dots folder to your home directory
  - Adjust the /Dots/Options files accordingly to your preferences. I will add more documentation here later (maybe).
